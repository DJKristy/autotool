This is a simple shell script to automatically create a local_manifest.xml file.

Place the auto.sh in the root of your source directory.

chmod a+x auto.sh

./auto.sh

After creation of xml file you have to manually type in the tags(<remove-project> and </manifest>)

This xml file removes some projects that I usually remove from default.xml
